        <p>
          I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in Java and manipulating it to produce a desired
          output, i have
          been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems, Software Development is a never
          ending puzzle
          that am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the
          lives of
          people around the entire WORLD.

          This passion carried me through my education to study Computer Science. Here there were more resources
          available to me
          than i ever could imagined as a kid, i studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, and
          more. And
          it was there that i learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

          There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build, and for this am very
          grateful.

          Skills/Interest: JavaScript, Node, React, CSS, Redux, RESTful App, GraphQL, Webpack, SQL, MongoDB, Git, TDD,
          Algorithms and Microservices.

          JavaScript, as you might know, is ubiquitous in todayâ€™s software development world. It is the foundation of
          frontend web
          development and is the key ingredient in frameworks like ReactJS, Angular, and VueJS. It can also help create
          solid
          backends with platforms like Nodejs, runs desktop applications like Slack, Atom, and Spotify, and runs on
          mobile phones
          as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

          I loves to plays interactive games, especially video games.

          Gaming is really a workout for your mind disguised as fun. Studies have shown that playing video games
          regularly may
          increase gray matter in the brain and boost brain connectivity.
